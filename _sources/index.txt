===========================
`mapmuts`_
===========================

`mapmuts`_ is a `Python`_ package for mapping mutations from deep-sequencing of protein-coding genes. It is specifically designed for the analysis of overlapping Illumina paired-end reads.

Please note that for many purposes, `mapmut`_ has been **superseded** by `dms_tools`_. Specifically, you are recommended to use `dms_tools`_ over `mapmuts`_ for:

    * Inference of site-specific amino-acid preferences

    * Inference of differential preferences between different selections

    * Creation of logo-plot style visualizations

`mapmuts`_ source code is available `on GitHub`_.

`mapmuts documentation`_ is available `on GitHub Pages`_.

The `mapmuts`_ package was created by `Jesse Bloom`_.


Using `mapmuts`_
===================
This package can be run using a series of scripts, and does not require you to directly interface with the `Python`_ modules.

Some examples are provided with the package; they can be found in the ``./examples/`` subdirectory of the main `mapmuts`_ package.
