applyfilter = True: all reads flagged Y  by the Illumina filter will be removed.

minq = 25.00: any read pair where the average Q-score of either read is < this will be removed.

upcase = 'test': converting fullgene, a1, and a2 to upper case.
Testing case of first R1 and R2 reads... test passed, first reads upper case.

Completed execution of mapmuts.main.MakeAlignments at Fri Jan 17 09:36:20 2014.
Pylab / matplotlib appear to be available, so we will make the summary plots.

pdflatex is available, so we will also make an overall summary PDF.

Now running mapmuts.main.MakeAlignmentsPlots...
Completed running mapmuts.main.MakeAlignmentsPlots.
