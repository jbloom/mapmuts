applyfilter = True: all reads flagged Y  by the Illumina filter will be removed.

minq = 25.00: any read pair where the average Q-score of either read is < this will be removed.

upcase = 'test': converting fullgene, a1, and a2 to upper case.
Testing case of first R1 and R2 reads... test passed, first reads upper case.

Now writing statistics to output files.
Writing summary statistics to replicate_1_mutvirus_alignmentstatistics.txt.
Writing insert length distribution to replicate_1_mutvirus_insertlengths.txt.
Writing R1 mismatch distribution to replicate_1_mutvirus_R1mismatches.txt.
Writing R2 mismatch distribution to replicate_1_mutvirus_R2mismatches.txt.

Completed execution of mapmuts.main.MakeAlignments at Fri Apr  4 13:37:57 2014.
Pylab / matplotlib appear to be available, so we will make the summary plots.

pdflatex is available, so we will also make an overall summary PDF.

Now running mapmuts.main.MakeAlignmentsPlots...
Completed running mapmuts.main.MakeAlignmentsPlots.
