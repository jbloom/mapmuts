Now writing nucleotide counts to replicate_3_DNA_ntcounts.txt

Now writing codon counts to replicate_3_DNA_codoncounts.txt

Finished executation of mapmuts.main.ParseNTCodonCounts at Sat Apr  5 09:59:47 2014.
Pylab / matplotlib appear to be available, so we will make the summary plots.

pdflatex is available, so we will also make an overall summary PDF.
