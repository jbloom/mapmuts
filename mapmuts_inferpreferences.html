<p>This script infers the equilibrium preferences of each site for each amino acid. It does this using a Bayesian approach implemented via MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo).</p>
<p>Because this script uses MCMC, it takes a fairly long time to run &#8211; perhaps as long as several days depending on your computer and the specific data set.</p>
<p>This script takes as input the <em>codoncounts.txt</em> files created by <a class="reference internal" href="mapmuts_parsecounts.html#mapmuts-parsecounts-py"><em>mapmuts_parsecounts.py</em></a>, and so is designed to be run after you have completed the analysis with that script.</p>
<div class="section" id="dependencies">
<h2>Dependencies<a class="headerlink" href="#dependencies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This script requires <a class="reference external" href="http://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc/">pymc</a> for the Bayesian inference, which in turn requires <a class="reference external" href="http://www.numpy.org/">numpy</a>. If you want the script to make plots, you also need <a class="reference external" href="http://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a>. The use of <a class="reference external" href="http://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc/">pymc</a> version 2.3 is strongly recommended over version 2.2 for better performance.</p>

<h2>Background and nomenclature<a class="headerlink" href="#background-and-nomenclature" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This script is designed for the analysis of plasmid mutant libraries and viruses grown from those libraries. Mutations in the plasmid mutant library will be subject to selection upon viral growth: favorable mutations will increase in frequency, and deleterious mutations will decrease in frequency. The equilibrium preferences inferred by this script represent the expected frequency of each amino acid at each site in a hypothetical experiment where all amino acids are initially introduced at equal frequency. For the purposes of this script, we also consider stop codons (denoted by * character) to be a possible amino acid, so there are really 21 possible identities at each site.</p>
<p>The equilibrium frequency of amino acid <em>a</em> at site <em>r</em> is represented by <span class="math">\(\pi_{r,a}\)</span>. If all amino acids are equally likely at a site, then we would expect <span class="math">\(\pi_{r,a} = 1 / 20 = 0.05\)</span> for the 20 amino acids and <span class="math">\(\pi_{r,a} = 0\)</span> for stop codons. If there is complete selection for a specific amino acid at a site, then we expect <span class="math">\(\pi_{r,a} = 1\)</span> for the favored amino acid and <span class="math">\(\pi_{r,a} = 0\)</span> for all other amino acids. When <span class="math">\(\pi_{r,a}\)</span> for a stop codon is greater than zero, that either indicates that there is selection to prematurely truncate the protein (unlikely in most cases), or simply provides an indication of the accuracy of the experiment / inference.</p>
<p>Note that it is in principle possible to infer a preference for each of the 64 codon identities. By instead inferring preferences only for amino acids, we are essentially assuming that all selection operates on amino acids, and synonymous codons are equivalent.</p>
<p>We consider an experiment that contains the following four samples:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><em>DNA</em> : This sample is simply unmutated wildtype DNA. It measures the sequencing error rate.</li>
<li><em>RNA</em> : This sample is reverse-transcribed RNA transcribed from unmutated wildtype DNA. It measures sequencing errors plus reverse-transcription errors.</li>
<li><em>mutDNA</em> : This sample is plasmid mutant library DNA. It measures the underlying mutagenesis rate in the mutant library plus sequencing errors.</li>
<li><em>mutvirus</em> : This sample is the virus mutant pool grown from the plasmid mutant library. It measures the selection on the mutations in the <em>mutDNA</em> library plus reverse-transcription and sequencing errors.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>If there were no sequencing or reverse transcription errors, then <span class="math">\(\pi_{r,a}\)</span> would be proportional to the number of times a mutation occurred in the <em>mutvirus</em> sample divided by the number of times that it occurred in the <em>mutDNA</em> sample, although there would of course be sampling errors that would bias the estimate for finite libraries. This script accounts for sources of error, and estimates the posterior distribution of <span class="math">\(\pi_{r,a}\)</span> given the sequencing data.</p>
<p>Sites are also characterized by their site entropy <span class="math">\(h_r = \sum_a \pi_{r,a} \cdot \log_2 \pi_{r,a}\)</span>. This site entropy is in bits, since the logarithm is to the base 2.</p>

<h2>Implementation of the MCMC<a class="headerlink" href="#implementation-of-the-mcmc" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The posterior distributions for the preferences are estimated by MCMC using the <a class="reference external" href="http://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc/">pymc</a> package. The script automatically tests for convergence using the <em>convergence</em> and <em>nruns</em> options. It is suggested that you use <em>nruns &gt; 1</em> and <em>stepincrease &gt; 1</em> so that you can try to ensure convergence. Substantial effort has been invested to make sure that by default the run will burn-in appropriately and set reasonable step sizes for the variables. The details of this implementation are documented in the source code.</p>
<p>The log file created by this script will include information about whether the inference for each site converged according the criterium set by <em>convergence</em>. If it consistently fails to converge, you might consider increasing <em>nsteps</em>.</p>
<p>When examining convergence, the difference between the <span class="math">\(\pi_{r,a}\)</span> values inferred from different runs is quantified as the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%E2%80%93Shannon_divergence">Shannon-Jensen divergence</a>. The logarithms are taken to the base 2, so this divergence can range from zero (identical inferred preferences) to one (completely independent inferred preferences).</p>

<h2>Running the script<a class="headerlink" href="#running-the-script" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To run this script from the prompt, first create a text infile of the
format described below. Then simply run the script with the single text file as the argument, as in:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>mapmuts_inferpreferences.py infile.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="input-file">
<h2>Input file<a class="headerlink" href="#input-file" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The input file is a text file with a series of <em>key</em> / <em>value</em> pairs. The required keys are indicated below. The values should not include spaces.</p>
<p>Lines beginning with # and empty lines are ignored.</p>
<p>Keys for the input file:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><em>DNA_files</em> : The input data for this script are the <em>_codoncounts.txt</em> files created by <a class="reference internal" href="mapmuts_parsecounts.html#mapmuts-parsecounts-py"><em>mapmuts_parsecounts.py</em></a>. For each library being used for the inference (and you can combine data from multiple libraries), this key should be followed by a string giving the path to the <em>_codoncounts.txt</em> file for the <em>DNA</em> sample. The number of files listed here must be the same as the number listed for <em>RNA_files</em>, <em>mutDNA_files</em>, and <em>mutvirus_files</em> as all four files are needed for each library &#8211; they should also be listed in the same order (i.e. library 1, library 2, etc). Only definitively called codons (both reads agree, upper case in the <em>_codoncounts.txt</em> file) are used in the counts.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>RNA_files</em> : like <em>DNA_files</em> but for the <em>RNA</em> samples.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>mutDNA_files</em> : like <em>DNA_files</em> but for the <em>mutDNA</em> samples.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>mutvirus_files</em> : like <em>DNA_files</em> but for the <em>mutvirus</em> samples.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>pi_concentration</em> : the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_parameter">concentration parameter</a> of the symmetric <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution">Dirichlet distribution</a>  used as the prior over the <span class="math">\(\pi_{r,a}\)</span> values. This is the parameter denoted as <span class="math">\(\sigma_{\pi}\)</span> in the full writeup in the <a class="reference internal" href="#inference-algorithm">Inference algorithm</a> section. Note that the concentration parameter here is taken to represent the value of each of the individual elements in the parameter vector. Choosing a value of <em>pi_concentration = 1</em> corresponds to a uniform prior over all of the possible vectors of <em>pi_concentration</em> values, and is probably what you want to choose unless you have a good reason to do otherwise. A value of <em>pi_concentration &gt; 1</em> favors vectors where all <em>pi_concentration</em> values aer similar, and a value of <em>pi_concentration &lt; 1</em> favors vectors where some <span class="math">\(\pi_{r,a}\)</span> values are large and others are small.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>epsilon_concentration</em> : the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_parameter">concentration parameter</a> of the (non-symmetric) <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution">Dirichlet distribution</a> used as a prior over the error rate observed in the <em>DNA</em> library. This is the parameter denoted as <span class="math">\(\sigma_{\epsilon}\)</span> in the full writeup in the <a class="reference internal" href="#inference-algorithm">Inference algorithm</a> section. The suggested value is one.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>mu_concentration</em> : the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_parameter">concentration parameter</a> of the (non-symmetric) <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution">Dirichlet distribution</a> used as a prior over the mutagenesis rate observed in the <em>mutDNA</em> library. This is the parameter denoted as <span class="math">\(\sigma_{\mu}\)</span> in the full writeup in the <a class="reference internal" href="#inference-algorithm">Inference algorithm</a> section. The suggested value is one.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>rho_concentration</em> : the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_parameter">concentration parameter</a> of the (non-symmetric) <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution">Dirichlet distribution</a> used as a prior over the reverse-transcription error rate in the <em>RNA</em> library. This is the parameter denoted as <span class="math">\(\sigma_{\rho}\)</span> in the full writeup in the <a class="reference internal" href="#inference-algorithm">Inference algorithm</a> section. The suggested value is one.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>minvalue</em> : a number specifying the minimum value for the prior estimates mutation and error rates determined from the overall library means. Having such a minimum value keeps any of the prior estimates from being set to zero or negative values. A reasonable value is <em>1e-7</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>seed</em> : integer seed for the random number generator. Runs with the same seed should generate exactly the same output. Otherwise the output may differ for different seeds as the MCMC uses random numbers.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>nruns</em> : the number of independent MCMC runs. Must be at least one, but it is recommended that you use <em>nruns</em> equal to at least 2 (and 3 is probably better), as this allows checks for MCMC convergence. When multiple runs are performed, the reported equilibrium preferences come from all runs.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>nsteps</em> : the number of steps for each MCMC run. A reasonable starting value is probably 100000, although this may need to be increased if convergence is poor. Note that the number of burn-in steps are not explicitly specified in this script, but the program implements internal methods that should ensure adequate burn-in that is not included in the output. You will have to look at the source code if you want to understand that in detail. The burn-in is set equal to 10% of <em>nsteps</em> with two pre-burn runs that are used to calibrate the step sizes. So the overall amount of burn-in is equal to 30% of <em>nsteps</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>thin</em> : the posterior is only recorded every <em>thin</em> steps. If you want to record every value, then set <em>thin</em> to one. However, consecutive steps are usually correlated, so it is often preferable to set <em>thin</em> to a number greater than one. A suggested value is 100. <em>nsteps</em> must be a multiple of <em>thin</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>convergence</em> : the test applied to the MCMC runs to see if they converged. This option is only meaningful if <em>nruns</em> &gt; 1 (as is recommended). For each pair of MCMC runs, we calculate the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%E2%80%93Shannon_divergence">Shannon-Jensen divergence</a> (logarithm base 2) between the <span class="math">\(\pi_{r,a}\)</span> values for all <em>a</em> for that value of <em>r</em>. If the runs converge to identical values, this difference will be zero, whereas its maximum value for highly diverged runs is one. We test whether the actual divergence is less than the value specified by <em>convergence</em>. If the difference is greater than <em>convergence</em>, then what is done next depends on the values of <em>stepincrease</em>. A recommended value for <em>convergence</em> is 0.01. The log file contains information about whether the inference converged for each site.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>stepincrease</em> : If the chain fails to converge for a given inference (according to the criterion of <em>convergence</em>), then the default action is to try to increase the number of steps to be equal to <em>stepincrease * nsteps</em>. We then test again for convergence for these longer MCMC runs. Typically increasing the step number might improve convergence. So <em>stepincrease</em> must be a number &gt;= 1. If it is one, that is equivalent to not doing any <em>stepincrease</em>. If <em>stepincrease</em> is greater than one, we then try running the MCMC for <em>stepincrease * nsteps</em> steps for each run. If the chain still does not converge, nothing further is done, but we do use the inferences from the longer chain. A suggested value of <em>stepincrease</em> is 4.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>MCMC_traces</em> is the directory to which we write plots showing the traces of the equilibrium preferences <span class="math">\(\pi_{r,a}\)</span> as a function of the number of MCMC steps after burn-in and thinning. If you set this to the string <em>None</em>, then no such plots are created. Otherwise, if <a class="reference external" href="http://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> is available, then files with the prefix specified by <em>outfileprefix</em> and the suffix corresponding to the residue (such as <em>residue_1.pdf</em> or <em>residue_334.pdf</em>) are created in the directory <em>MCMC_traces</em>. Note that this directory must already exist; it is NOT created.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>preference_plots</em> is the directory to which we write plots showing the equilibrium preferences for all amino acids at a site. Shown are the posterior mean and the median-centered 95% credible interval of the posterior. If you set this to the string <em>None</em>, then no such plots are created. Otherwise, if <a class="reference external" href="http://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> is available, then files with the prefix specified by <em>outfileprefix</em> and the suffix corresponding to the residue (such as <em>residue_1.pdf</em> or <em>residue_334.pdf</em>) are created in the directory <em>preference_plots</em>. Note that this directory must already exist; it is NOT created.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>outfileprefix</em> is a string giving the prefix for the output files described below.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>ncpus</em> is an option that allows you to run the analyses using multiple CPUs. This will usually be helpful, because these runs can take a long time. If you set <em>ncpus</em> to 1, then we just use one CPU. But if you are working on a multi-threaded processor, then setting to a larger number will take advantage of the additional CPUs. Note however that if you set <em>ncpus</em> to a number larger than the number of spare CPUs, you will overload the processor &#8211; so if you only have one CPU, set this to just 1.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>removeoutlier</em> is an option that can only be used if there are 3 or more libraries specified by <em>DNA_files</em>, <em>RNA_files</em>, <em>mutDNA_files</em>, and <em>mutvirus_files</em>. If there are three or more libraries, this option specifies that for each site, we attempt to identify the one library that is an outlier at this site in terms of the inferred <span class="math">\(\pi_{r,a}\)</span> values. This single outlier library is then excluded from the final inference of the <span class="math">\(\pi_{r,a}\)</span> values. The rationale for using this option is that occasionally one library appears to give much different <span class="math">\(\pi_{r,a}\)</span> values (usually a much larger value for some specific value of <em>a</em>) than the other libraries &#8211; this is probably due to linkage of that mutation with another beneficial mutation. Therefore, identifying the one outlier and removing it from the analysis could be helpful. The concern of course is that this needs to be done in some unbiased way rather than just cherry-picking libraries for removal at specific sites. This option does that &#8211; a single outlier library is removed for all sites according to the following well-defined algorithm is applied to the inference of the <span class="math">\(\pi_{r,a}\)</span> values for each site <em>r</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>For each of the libraries specified (by <em>DNA_file</em>, <em>RNA_files</em>, etc), the <span class="math">\(\pi_{r,a}\)</span> values are inferred just using the data from that individual library.</li>
<li>For each of the libraries, we compute the <strong>average</strong> pairwise <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%E2%80%93Shannon_divergence">Shannon-Jensen divergence</a> (logarithms base 2) between the <span class="math">\(\pi_{r,a}\)</span> values for that library and all of the other libraries. We identify the library with the highest average pairwise divergence to the other libraries as the outlier at this site.</li>
<li>We then infer the <span class="math">\(\pi_{r,a}\)</span> values using the data from all of the libraries <strong>except</strong> the one identified as the outlier. This set of <span class="math">\(\pi_{r,a}\)</span> value is what is reported as the amino-acid preferences for site <em>r</em>.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>If you want to do this type of removal of outliers, then set <em>removeoutlier</em> to <em>True</em>. Otherwise set it to <em>False</em>. Note that an error will be raised if <em>removeoutlier</em> is <em>True</em> but fewer than 3 libraries are specified.</p>
