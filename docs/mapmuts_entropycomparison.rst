=========================================

This script is designed to compare the site entropy calculated from the amino-acid preferences between two sets of sites, controlling for solvent accessibility. You might want to use this script to test if one set of sites has a higher site entropy than the other. You are required to know a crystal structure so that you can have computed accessibilities for the residues. The reason is that it is well known that solvent accessibility is correlated with site entropy, so comparing site entropies between sets only makes sense if solvent accessibility is controlled for.

Dependencies
---------------
This script requires:

* `matplotlib`_ to make the plots.

* `rpy2`_ to run the `R`_ statistical package.

* The `R`_ statistical package.


Running the script
--------------------
To run this script, simply create an input file with the format described below. If you name your input file ``infile.txt``, then run the command::

    mapmuts_entropycomparison.py infile.txt


Input file
--------------
The input file is a text file with a series of *key* / *value* pairs. The required keys are indicated below. The values should not include spaces.

Lines beginning with # and empty lines are ignored.

Keys for the input file:

* *aapreferences* : The name of the file giving the site-specific amino-acid preferences :math:`\pi_{r,a}`. Typically this would be the ``*_equilibriumpreferences.txt`` file created by :ref:`mapmuts_inferpreferences.py`. These site-specific amino-acid preferences are used to calculate the site entropies.

  The file has a header, and then for each site *r* there is a line giving the site entropy :math:`h_r` and all of the preferences :math:`\pi_{r,a}`. It is acceptable for a preference for a stop codon (denoted by a * character) to be either present or absent -- but all other 20 amino acids must always be present. Here is an example of a few lines of such a file::

    #SITE   WT_AA   SITE_ENTROPY    PI_A    PI_C    PI_D    PI_E    PI_F    PI_G    PI_H    PI_I    PI_K    PI_L    PI_M    PI_N    PI_P    PI_Q    PI_R    PI_S    PI_T    PI_V    PI_W    PI_Y    PI_*

* *includestop* : an optional argument specifying whether we count stop codons as possible amino acids when computing the site entropies. There may be stop codons as possible amino acids in *aapreferences*. If there are not stop codons, then the value of *includestop* is irrelevant. If there are stop codons, the *includestop* specifies whether these are included as possible amino acids -- if *True* then they are, if *False* then they are not. Failing to specify *includestop* is equivalent to setting it to *False*.

* *dsspfile* is specifies the solvent accessibilities computed from a crystal structure; these are used to compute the relative solvent accessibility (RSA). 
  You can then use the `DSSP`_ webserver to calculate the solvent accessibilities. This script is tested against output from the `DSSP`_ webserver, but should probably work on output from the standalone too. Then save the `DSSP`_ output in a text file, and specify the path to that file as the value for *dsspfile*. This script does not currently have a robust ability to parse the `DSSP`_ output, so you have to do some careful checks. In particular, you must make sure that residue numbers in the PDB file exactly match the residue numbering scheme used for the rest of this analysis (i.e. the same residue numbers found in *aapreferences*, and that none of the residue numbers contain letter suffixes (such as 24A) as is sometimes the case in PDB files. It is not necessary that all of the residues be present in the PDB. If there are multiple PDB chains, you can specify them using the *dsspchain* option. `DSSP`_ only calculates absolute accessible surface areas (ASAs); the RSAs are computed by normalizing by the maximum ASAs given by `Tien et al, 2013`_.

* *dsspchain* should specify the chain in the PDB file (such as *A*) that we want to use. If there is only one chain, you can set this option to *None*.

* *plotfile* is the name of the output plot that is created. It is a PDF, and so should end in the extension ``*.pdf``.

* *alpha* specifies the alpha value (transparency) for the plot. A value of *1.0* means no transparency, and smaller values (such as *0.2* mean more transparency). If you do not include this value, then *alpha* is set to 1.0 by default.

* *siterange* specifies the range of residues that are included in the analysis. The value should be two numbers giving the first and the last residues to include in the plots. You would use this option if you want to only consider a certain range of residues. If you want to include all of the residues, just set to this to be the string *all*. 

* *selectedsites* is the name of a file that lists the sites that are the selected subset that we are comparing to all other sites. This should be a text file. Lines beginning with # or empty lines are ignored. All other lines should have an integer as their first number, and this is read as the site number. Any other entries on the line are ignored. So in this example file::

    # example selectesites file
    1
    2
    # don't include 3
    4 # we do include this residue

  specifies that we include residues 1, 2, and 4 as selected sites.

* *linearmodelfile* is the name of a created file that holds the results of the linear model analysis as described in `Output`_ below. This file is written in text format.

Example input file
---------------------
Here is an example input file::

    # input file for mapmuts_entropycomparison.py
    dsspfile ./PDB_structure/1RVX_trimer_renumbered.dssp
    dsspchain A
    aapreferences combined_amino_acid_preferences.txt
    plotfile corr.pdf
    lienarmodelfile linearmodelresults.txt
    alpha 1.0
    siterange 2 365
    selectedsites Caton_H1_HA_antigenic_sites.txt


Output
--------
The analysis considers all sites that are specified in both *aapreferences* and in *dsspfile* and are also in site range.

There are two output. First, the PDF file specified by *plotfile* is created. All of the non-selected sites are shown in blue circles, and the selected sites are shown in red triangles. An example plot is shown below:

.. figure:: example_entropycomparison_plot.jpg
    :width: 40%
    :align: center
    :alt: example_entropycomparison_plot.jpg
    
    Example of the *plotfile* plot created by this script.
    
The second output is the result of an `R`_ linear model analysis (`R`_ function ``lm``) that looks for the correlations of RSA and presence in *selectedsites* with site entropy. Essentially, this analysis regresses site entropy against both RSA and the presence in *selectedsites* (coded as 0 if not in *selectedsites*, and 1 if in *selectedsites*). The results of the analysis are written to *linearmodelfile*. The interesting results will be at the bottom of the file. For example, here is an example output (bottom part of file)::
